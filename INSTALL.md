## Building a Ubuntu COW (Cluster of Workstation)
For users who want to build a cluster for high-performance computing from scratch, I introduce here how to build an Ubuntu Cluster using desktops.

### What is COW?
COW is the acronym of **_cluster of workstation_**. A workstation is a single computer equipped with high-performance hardwares.
Hardware for workstations usually involves additional functions that are not included in the hardware for ordinary uses.

### Ubuntu installation
1. Download the ISO image file from [Ubuntu download](https://ubuntu.com/download/server#download). We highly recommend a server image because, without GUI, a COW is more stable and nimble.
1. Install the Ubuntu using USB or other methods. During the setup, choose to install OpenSSH for convenience.
2. Acquire root authentication right after the installation is finished.
3. Repeat the aboves for each node.
